"""No raw WHERE read outside a reviewed place, and one definition of a probe.

Three times a fragment of a heating WHERE was routed as if it were a zone:
actuator ``Z#N`` (#333), pump ``0#N`` (#431), probe ``PZZ`` (#549). Each fix was
one more special case in one more place. ``where_grammar`` now holds the WHO 4
grammar; this test keeps it that way.

* Reading ``message.where`` (or ``getattr(x, "where")``) is allowed only in the
  functions listed in ``REVIEWED``, each with the reason it is safe. A new read
  fails here until someone has looked at it - then add it with a reason.
* ``PZZ`` (WHERE >= 100) is spelled out only in ``where_grammar``.
