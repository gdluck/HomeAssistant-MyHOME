# #466 MyHomeServer1 sweep with a controlled setpoint experiment

Verbatim bus trace (a truncated 200-frame tail: the card was armed at 18:17:14, the buffer starts at 18:19:24; the setpoint experiment is complete) contributed by **@gdluck** on [#466](https://github.com/OpenWebNet-HA/MyHOME/issues/466)
(bus card export, HA 2026.9.4, integration 2.0.0b13, OWNd 2.0.0b8, gateway firmware 3.87.13). Never edit a frame.

| File | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `myhome_sweep_MyHomeServer1_all_2026-09-29T18-20-22.json` | Sweep export (200 frames, buffer truncated) | Lighting status sweep, zone-state sweep of 32 zones (35-70), then setpoint writes on zones 60, 68 and 55. |

## What it shows

- **Setpoint write echo**: `*#4*Z*#14*T*1##` is answered by `*#4*Z*12*T*3##`, `*4*1*Z##` and the temperature; no dimension 7 or 14 echo. An unchanged repeat write gets only the temperature back.
- **Zone 55 (measured 24.6 C)**, setpoint above the room: actuator `*#4*55#1*20*1##`, ~2.3 s later pump call `*4*4001#55*0#3##` + `*#4*0#3*20*1##`.
  Setpoint below: pump stops (`*4*4002#55*0#3##`, `*#4*0#3*20*0##`, `*4*4002*55##`) about 2 s **before** the valve closes (`*#4*55#1*20*0##`).
- `*#1*66*4*100*4##`: unsolicited WHO 1 dimension 4 report on point 66 (undocumented for WHO 1).
- Dimension 12 carries mode `3` on an ordinary manual heating write.

## Diagnostics download (startup poll)

`diagnostics_MyHomeServer1_startup_poll_2026-09-29T18-31.json`: the same gateway's HA diagnostics download
([#466 comment 5896287944](https://github.com/OpenWebNet-HA/MyHOME/issues/466#issuecomment-5896287944)), with 500 bus frames
of one startup poll (18:29:10 - 18:31:17). The config-entry id (`entry_id`, the `setup_times` key and the issue id) and the time zone were made
synthetic (`01PLANT000000000000000466`, `UTC`); host, MAC and password were already redacted by the download. The `home_assistant` block keeps only the installation type, version and time zone, and only the `myhome` custom component is listed. `scripts/anonymize_plant_fixture.py --check` passes.

- The integration polls `*#4*Z##` once per climate zone, one after the other. A zone that answers costs ~1.3 s of the queue.
- Eleven restored zones (0-4, 6, 32, 33, 71, 75, 76) never answer: no frame of theirs is on the bus, and consecutive polls are ~6.4 s apart, ~70 s in total. The buffer records no `NACK` frame (a refused status request is not recorded), so what the capture proves is the wait, not how the gateway ended it; the 10 s `COMMAND_TIMEOUT` of OWNd is from its source, not from this trace.
- Zones 36, 40, 42, 55, 60 and 68 answer dimensions 0, 12, 13 and 14 but no dimension 7 (#454).
