"""Decoder pool manager for the MyHOME Dynamic Proxy.

Manages a pool of streaming decoders (squeezelite / Cambridge Audio) that are
physically connected to the BTicino F441M matrix source inputs.  The proxy
intercepts Music Assistant / Spotify play_media commands, claims an idle decoder
from this pool, routes the BTicino matrix to the correct source input, and
forwards the stream URL to the backend decoder.

Architecture
------------
- One ``DecoderPool`` instance per gateway, keyed by MAC address in
  ``entry.runtime_data.decoder_pool``.
- Survives entity reloads (lives on the config entry, not inside an entity).
- Thread-safe: all claim/release operations are serialised with a single
  ``asyncio.Lock`` to prevent race conditions when multiple zones compete for
  the last available decoder.
- State-aware: inspects the live HA entity state of each decoder to determine
  whether it is truly idle before claiming.
- Persistent: the books (who holds which decoder, who is grouped with whom) are
  saved to ``.storage`` after every change and restored at startup, because the
  amplifiers keep playing through a Home Assistant restart.  A restored zone
  stays *unconfirmed* until the bus reports its amplifier; see
  :meth:`DecoderPool.confirm_zone` and :meth:`DecoderPool.drop_unconfirmed`.

Gain staging (anti-hiss)
------------------------
Each decoder carries an optional ``pre_gain`` offset (0–100 %).  When the user
adjusts the BTicino zone volume the proxy also sets the decoder volume to
``zone_volume + pre_gain``, capped at 1.0.  This keeps the analog signal level
high and the BTicino amplifier gain low, which reduces the inherent noise floor
of the 2-wire bus.

Typical values
--------------
- Cambridge Audio with Pre-Amp OFF: ``pre_gain = 0`` (already at full line level)
- Squeezelite / piCorePlayer:       ``pre_gain = 20``
