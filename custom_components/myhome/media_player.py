"""Support for MyHome audio zones with Dynamic Proxy for streaming services.

Architecture
------------
The MyHOME BTicino F441M (and similar) is a **hardware-only analog matrix** — it cannot
decode IP streams directly.  This module bridges Music Assistant, Spotify Connect,
and other sources to the matrix by implementing a *Dynamic Proxy* pattern:

**Recommended model — "Hardware Routing First"**

1. Physically wire your network decoder(s) (squeezelite, Cambridge Audio, etc.)
   to the desired F441M source input(s) (Source 1–4).
2. Configure each decoder's physical source number in the integration Options.
3. Use physical wall panels (or a gateway power-on scenario) to route zones
   to the streaming source input. This is the cleanest, hiss-free approach.
4. When Music Assistant calls ``play_media`` on a zone, the proxy:
   a. Claims an idle backend decoder from the shared :class:`~.decoder_pool.DecoderPool`.
   b. Wakes the decoder if it is in standby.
   c. Activates the BTicino zone amplifier with a simple OFF → ON sequence.
      Once the matrix is described in the options (a source name or an
      environment default), the zone's environment is also routed to the
      decoder's input.  Without that the routing set at the wall panels is
      trusted, as in earlier releases.
   d. Forwards the stream URL to the backend decoder via the HA service bus.
5. State, metadata (title, artist, album art), and volume are mirrored from
   the backend decoder back to the BTicino zone entity.
6. Volume changes on the zone apply **gain staging** (decoder volume =
   zone_volume + pre_gain) to keep the analog signal level high and reduce bus noise.
7. When the zone is turned off, the decoder is released back to the pool.

Source selection
----------------
Selecting a source sends the same two frames a wall panel puts on the bus:
``*16*3*10S##`` activates source ``S`` and ``*16*3*1ES##`` routes environment
``E`` to it.  The routing address carries the *environment* digit of the
amplifier address, not the amplifier digit: zone ``23`` lives in environment
``2``, so source 1 is ``121`` and source 2 is ``122``.  The F441M switches per
output and an output serves a whole environment, so every amplifier in that
environment follows the switch; that is matrix hardware behaviour.

Two consequences are enforced here rather than left to chance:

- One environment carries one stream.  A zone cannot claim a decoder while
  another zone of its environment holds one, and a default source is not
  applied over an environment that is streaming.
- Environment 0 (amplifiers ``01``-``09``) has no routing address: ``10S`` is
  the source device itself.  Selecting a source there is refused.

Earlier versions refused to send these frames, believing they caused relay
hiss on MH200-class gateways.  Bus captures on an MH200 show clean switching;
the real problem was a routing address built from the wrong digit, which
addressed an environment that does not exist.

Unconfigured sources
--------------------
A wall panel can route a room to a matrix input that has nothing wired to it,
which sounds like silence or amplifier noise.  When the user has named their
sources in the options, the entity labels such a zone as unconfigured and logs
it once, but never overrides the choice: silently re-routing a room the user
just switched by hand would be its own kind of surprise.

Backward compatibility
----------------------
If no decoders are configured in Options Flow the entity behaves exactly as
before — it controls the BTicino amplifier zone via WHO=16 commands only.
``PLAY_MEDIA`` is not advertised and Music Assistant will not try to use it.
