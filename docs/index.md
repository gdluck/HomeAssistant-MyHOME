# MyHOME for Home Assistant

Welcome to the official documentation for the **MyHOME** Home Assistant integration.

This integration connects your BTicino / Legrand MyHOME SCS bus systems via OpenWebNet IP & Serial gateways (such as **F454**, **MH200**, **MH200N**, **MH201**, **MH202**, **MyHomeServer1**, **F461**, or **Legrand 3578 USB**) directly into Home Assistant.

## 🌟 Next-Gen Architecture: v2.0

The v2.0 architecture represents a complete modernization of the integration, featuring:

- **UI-First Configuration**: Streamlined gateway setup, automatic on-wire bus discovery, and device management via Home Assistant's native Config Flow and Options Flow (with backward compatibility for existing `myhome.yaml` files and SCS groups).
- **Native Automation Device Triggers**: Automate physical CEN (`WHO = 15`) and CEN+ (`WHO = 25`) scenario pushbuttons directly in Home Assistant's automation builder (Short press, Long press, Release, and Rotary Encoder dials).
- **In-Band Diagnostic Bus Monitor**: Real-time Lovelace card (`custom:myhome-bus-card`) providing live OpenWebNet frame monitoring, filtering, bus sweeping, and 1-click trace export without consuming extra gateway sockets.
- **Diffusione Sonora Dynamic Proxy**: Stream music from Music Assistant or Spotify into BTicino analog audio matrix amplifier zones (`WHO = 16`) with automatic power management and anti-hiss gain staging.
- **Decoupled OWNd 2.0 Engine**: Clean protocol abstraction preventing drift, backed by 1,600+ regression tests with 100% code coverage.
