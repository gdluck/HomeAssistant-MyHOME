# OpenWebNet Protocol & WHO Specifications Archive

Welcome to the **OpenWebNet Protocol & WHO Specifications Archive**. This document serves as the official open-access registry and cross-check inventory of all technical manuals, frame syntax, dimension definitions, and PDF specifications published by BTicino / Legrand for the OpenWebNet protocol across MyHOME systems.

Historically, these technical specifications were distributed through the *MyOpen Community* portal (`myopen-legrandgroup.com` / `myopen-bticino.it`), which is no longer active. To ensure that developers, installers, and community members have permanent access to accurate protocol documentation, we maintain this centralized registry.

## 📑 Protocol Clarifications & Subsystem Distinctions

### 1. CEN/CEN+ Scenario Schedulers (`WHO_15-25.pdf`) vs Dry Contacts & IR (`WHO_25.pdf`)

A common source of confusion in the OpenWebNet ecosystem stems from the shared `WHO = 25` code. As highlighted by **@GianlucaCh**, these are two completely distinct official specifications:

1. **Scenario Scheduler CEN / CEN+ (`WHO_15-25.pdf`)**:
   - **Covered Devices**: Scenario Programmers and Controllers (MH200, MH200N, MH201, Legrand 03565).
   - **Protocol Nature**: Pushbutton scenario trigger events.
   - **Syntax**: `*25*<WHAT>*<WHERE>##` where `WHAT` encodes:
     - `21`: Short pressure (< 0.5 seconds).
     - `22`: Start of extended pressure (>= 0.5 seconds).
     - `23`: Extended pressure holding.
     - `24`: Release after extended pressure.
   - **Addressing (`WHERE`)**: Scenario address up to 256 buttons/scenarios (`[1-256]`).

2. **Dry Contact Interfaces & IR Sensors (`WHO_25.pdf`)**:
   - **Covered Devices**: Physical interface modules (BTicino 3477, F428, 3480, F482, IR 4610/4611/4640; Legrand 573996, 03553, 067513, etc.).
   - **Protocol Nature**: Hardware state telemetry for magnetic window/door reed switches, technical contacts, and passive infrared motion detectors.
   - **Syntax**: `*25*<WHAT>*<WHERE>##` or dimension frames where `WHAT` indicates:
     - `31`: Contact ON / IR detection (closed contact or motion detected).
     - `32`: Contact OFF / IR not detected (opened contact or motion cleared).
   - **Parameter (`PARAM`)**:
     - `PARAM = 0`: State response upon polling request.
     - `PARAM = 1`: State response upon real-time system event.
   - **Home Assistant Entity**: Exposed as `binary_sensor` (e.g. window opened/closed, PIR motion).

---

### 2. Multi-Room Sound Distribution (`WHO = 16`) vs Sound Diffusion (`WHO = 22`)

The sound subsystem is split across two dedicated OpenWebNet WHO families:

1. **WHO = 16 (Sound Distribution — Zone & Matrix Management)**:
   - Controls physical audio amplifiers and source matrix units (F441, F441M, F450, 3487).
   - Functions include: Zone power (ON/OFF), volume attenuation (0–31 scale / percentages), audio input channel routing (IN 1 to IN 4), tone equalizers (bass, treble, balance), and master room follow-me.
   - Mapped to Home Assistant `media_player` entities.

2. **WHO = 22 (Sound Diffusion — Source & Speaker Navigation)**:
   - Controls the audio source devices themselves (FM tuner, CD player, multimedia source) and individual speaker units.
   - Functions include:
     - FM tuner frequency step up/down (`WHAT = 5` / `WHAT = 6`).
     - Station preset navigation (`WHAT = 9` next / `WHAT = 10` previous).
     - Track navigation (`WHAT = 11` next track / `WHAT = 12` previous track).
     - RDS text string display streaming (`WHAT = 31` start / `WHAT = 32` stop).
     - Direct frequency tuning and preset memorization (`WHAT = 33`).
     - Speaker volume adjustment (`WHAT = 3` increase / `WHAT = 4` decrease).

---

### 3. Actuator Diagnostics & Endpoint Safety Locks (`WHO = 14`)

BTicino and Legrand never distributed a standalone `WHO_14.pdf` in their public developer distributions, retaining it as an internal/installer diagnostic function. However, the protocol grammar is fully reverse-engineered and verified across live systems:

- **Protocol Function**: Inhibits physical wall buttons (rocker switches, CEN pushbuttons) and remote actuation for safety, maintenance, or child locking on lighting and cover/shutter actuators (F411, F411U2, F418, LN4672M2).
- **Lock Actuator (Disable Controls)**: `*14*0*<WHERE>##`
  - Freezes the relay in its current position and disables physical switch inputs.
- **Unlock Actuator (Enable Controls)**: `*14*1*<WHERE>##`
  - Restores normal operation and re-enables physical wall buttons and bus commands.
- **Status Query**: `*#14*<WHERE>##`
  - Returns `*14*0*<WHERE>##` (Locked) or `*14*1*<WHERE>##` (Unlocked).
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Represented via configuration button entities (`DisableCommandButtonEntity` and `EnableCommandButtonEntity`) under each actuator device.
- **Gateway Support**: Supported on modern gateways (F454, MyHomeServer1). Older gateways (e.g. early F455 firmware) return NACK (`*#*0##`).

## 🪄 CEN / CEN+ Automation & Community Blueprints

One of the most powerful capabilities of physical MyHOME installations is using existing BTicino wall pushbuttons and dry contact modules (such as the **3477** interface) to trigger automations across modern smart home ecosystems.

### 🌟 Community Blueprint: MyHome CEN+ Commands

A highly recommended blueprint developed by the Home Assistant community (by **gST84**) is available on the Home Assistant Community Forum:

👉 **[MyHome - CEN+ commands Blueprint (Community Forum)](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/myhome-cen-commands/260345)**  
👉 **[Raw Blueprint Source YAML (GitHub)](https://github.com/gST84/myHome_blueprints/blob/f4f3151aab73d85b0ab098b67f51d68e731f534f/CENplus/myhome-cen-plus.yaml)**

### Key Features of the Blueprint:
1. **Control Non-BTicino Devices**: Use your native BTicino wall switches to switch or toggle non-BTicino smart devices (Philips Hue, Zigbee, Z-Wave, Shelly, or Tuya).
2. **Short vs. Long Press Handling**:
   - **Short Press (< 0.5s)**: Instantly toggles lights or triggers scenes.
   - **Extended / Long Press (>= 0.5s)**: Enables smooth dimming up or down.
3. **Dimming Direction Helper**:
   - By creating a simple `input_boolean` helper (e.g. `input_boolean.living_dim_direction`), the blueprint tracks dimming direction so alternating long presses cycle between brightening and dimming.
4. **Zero-Delay Bus Processing**: Fully compatible with the stateless `myhome.cen` and `myhome.cen_plus` events dispatched by the modernized MyHOME integration.

## 🔍 OpenWebNet Frame Syntax Quick Reference

OpenWebNet messages always begin with `*` and end with `##`. Fields are separated by `*`:

1. **Standard Command / Status Message**:
   ```text
   *WHO*WHAT*WHERE##
   ```
   *Example*: `*1*1*21##` (Turn ON light at address A=2, PL=1)

2. **Dimension Request (Query)**:
   ```text
   *#WHO*WHERE*DIMENSION##
   ```
   *Example*: `*#4*1*0##` (Query measured temperature of Zone 1)

3. **Dimension Writing (Command with Parameters)**:
   ```text
   *#WHO*WHERE*#DIMENSION*VAL1*VAL2*...*VALn##
   ```
   *Example*: `*#16*1*#1*30##` (Set volume of audio Amplifier 1 to 30%)

4. **Dimension Response (Status Report)**:
   ```text
   *#WHO*WHERE*DIMENSION*VAL1*VAL2*...*VALn##
   ```
   *Example*: `*#4*1*0*0215*1##` (Zone 1 temperature is 21.5 °C, Heating mode)

5. **Acknowledge (ACK / NACK)**:
   - `*#*1##` : **ACK** (Command accepted by gateway/bus)
   - `*#*0##` : **NACK** (Command rejected, syntax error, or buffer busy)

## 🛠️ Testing & Live Bus Capture in Home Assistant

To capture raw OpenWebNet frames from physical hardware or diagnostic sessions:

1. Add the Lovelace Bus Monitor Card to your dashboard:
   ```yaml
   type: custom:myhome-openwebnet-bus-monitor
   # Note: custom:myhome-bus-card is also supported as an alias
   ```
2. Operate your devices (e.g. adjust a DALI color ballast, toggle a dry contact switch, or change audio volume).
3. Click **`📋 Report Issue / Copy Trace`** to copy a sanitized diagnostics report with the exact bus frames.
